Project Plotting - Matplotlib Seaborn, Histograms and Boxplots
The most recent ASC23 considered four major systems-based tracks with a view to providing region-focused contributions to inform the global stocktake among them Cities, urban and rural settlements, infrastructure, and transport.

In this assignment, you will be performing analysis more specifically on transport (vehicles and fuel efficiency).

The dataset has been provided for you.

You are tasked to make sense of this data that will later be used for AI purposes.

Play Around with Bin size as you create your Histogram

Bin size in Matplot Lib

image.png

Description The dataset has a number of different statistics that describe fuel efficiency.

TO DO:

create a histogram that depicts the distribution of carbon Dioxide
Play around with different bin width sizes to see what best depicts the data
Create 2 more histograms based on columns of your choice

[ ]
'''
This block of code extracts the Carbon dioxide emission column
from the the dataset and visualise it
with a histogram

'''
Co2_emission = df['co2']
sns.set(style="whitegrid")

sns.histplot(Co2_emission, bins=20, color='orange', edgecolor='black')
plt.xlabel('CO2 Emissions')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Distribution of Carbon Dioxide Emissions')
plt.show()
print(Co2_emission.head(10))


Interpretation : The histogram shows how much carbon dioxide cars release. Most cars release between 250 and 450 grams of CO2 for every mile they drive(Not really sure about the units). There are only a few cars that release more or less than that. the x-axis has Co2 emission and y-axis has frequency

'''
This block of code extracts the Engine Displacement column
from the the dataset and visualise it
with a histogram

'''
Displacement = df['displ']
sns.set(style="whitegrid")
sns.histplot(data=df, x='displ', color='skyblue', edgecolor='black', bins=20)
plt.xlabel('Engine Displacement')


Interpretation : The engine size histogram shows how many vehicles have different engine sizes. Most vehicles have common engine sizes, with only a few having very small or very big engines. The y-axis is frequency while x-axis is engine displacement

[ ]

'''
This block of code extracts the combined fuel efficient column
from the the dataset and visualise it
with a histogram

'''
Combfuel= df['comb']
sns.histplot(data=df, x='comb', color='green', edgecolor='black', bins=20)
plt.xlabel('Combined Fuel Efficiency')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Distribution of Combined Fuel Efficiency')
plt.show()
print(Combfuel.head(10))

Double-click (or enter) to edit

Interpretation : The combined fuel efficiency histogram shows how efficient vehicles are in using fuel. Many vehicles have high efficiency ratings. The x-axis depitcts fuel efficiency while frequency is on the y-axis

TO DO: Write Code that will give you the following plot as below:

create a heat map of the data
Interpret the data - What story does the visualization tell?
Finally What Columns would you delete Drop if the target is the ghg score? Justify your Answer

'''
The block extract all numerical columns and make a correlation heatmap with the extracted column
'''
numbercolumns = df.select_dtypes(include=['number'])

corr_matrix = numbercolumns.corr()

# Create a heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(9, 6))
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt=".2f")
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap of Fuel Economy Data')

plt.show()

Double-click (or enter) to edit

Interpretation: The heatmap demonstrates strong positive correlations between certain features, such as Urban fuel economy (Ucity) and Highway fuel economy (UHighway), which is expected since they influence each other. Similarly, there is a correlation between city and Ucity. Another notable observation from the heatmap is that combined fuel and greenhouse gas scores positively correlate because higher fuel consumption tends to lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions.

Columns to Remove: When focusing on ghgScore as the target, there are certain columns that are either irrelevant or have minimal impact on ghgScore. These include "id" and "year," which serve merely as identifiers and dropping them wouldn't result in any loss of data related to ghgScore. Additionally, "Displacement" and "Cylinders" exhibit very weak negative correlations with ghgScore, hence they are unnecessary. Essentially, columns with negative correlations or those that are irrelevant should be eliminated to ensure a clearer observation of ghgScore.
